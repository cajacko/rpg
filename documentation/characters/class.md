# Character class

## There are 3 main class types in this style of game
1. Physical
	This character type represents a physical play style, focused on a mele oriented approach to combat, plus a visible and personal approach to interaction.
2. Subtle
	This character type embodies brain over brawn. Either relying on stealth or ranged combat. Interactions with other characters would sometimes be more subterfuge or trickery than straight forward.
3. Magic
	These characters possess the ability to use magic, and as such their combat style would likely revolve around the use of such. Character interactions could be more academic or spiritual in nature, reflecting the study or circumstance that enables such an existence.

## Physical
Physical characters would gain an additional combat or physical interactive ability. E.g intimidate.

## Subtle
Subtle characters would gain an additional stealth or subterfuge ability. E.g. Hide in shadows/slight of hand.

## Magic
Magic characters would gain an additional magical ability, likely related to the type of magic user that was created. E.g. Lay on hands/Ignite
