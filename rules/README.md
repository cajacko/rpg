## Setup

### Materials

- Cards (card properties named in the brackets)
  - Character cards (Name, race, image, health, dexterity, strength, intelligence, charisma, flavour text)
  - Attribute cards (Title, image, how it may affect checks)
  - Ability cards (Title, image, effect)
  - Weapon cards (Title, image, effect, average damage rating)
  - Equipment cards (Title, image, description)
  - Enemy cards (Title, image, health, attributes, weapons, equipment, abilities, flavour text)
  - NPC cards (Title, image, health, attributes, weapons, equipment, abilities)
- A **Battle Map** (For visualising where people are during battles)
- **Pawns** for the battle map
- A whiteboard marker for the **Battle Map**
- Counters (For damage, ammo etc)
- Scenario sheets
- Initiative cards

### Story Setup

- Decide on 1 player to be the **Game Master**, they will be narrating the events of the story for the players.
- As a group pick a scenario sheet or one online that you like the title and description of
- The **Game Master** privately reads the whole scenario so they know what is going on and follows any special setup instructions
- The **Game Master** prepares the **Enemy cards**, **NPC cards** and any Weapon or Equipment cards needed to be put aside for the scenario (before any other player draws cards)

### Creating Characters

For each player do the following:

- Pick 1 **Character** card
- Randomly pick 3 attributes positive side up and 3 negative side up
- Pick 2 random **Weapon cards**
- Pick 2 random **Equipment cards**
- Pick 3 random **Ability cards**
- Start thinking about your characters back story and motivations

## Playing

### Taking Actions and Outcomes (Making a Check)

For any **Action** where the **Outcome** is uncertain, the character or object initiating that **Action** will need
to do a **Check** to see how the it pans out. Do they succeed spectacularly, fail miserably, or does not much
happen?

A check is split into 3 stages:

1. [Judging the Difficulty](#judging-the-difficulty)
2. [Rolling for the Outcome](#rolling-for-the-outcome)
3. [What Happened](#what-happened)

You may also want to see [Deciding how Much Damage to Deal](#deciding-how-much-damage-to-deal) when
deciding [What Happened](#what-happened)

#### Judging the Difficulty

The GM decides how challenging it is based off the
[Difficulty Scale](#difficulty-scale) (From the point of view of the character, monster or object
initiating the action). They take into account characters skills (advantages make something easier,
disadvantages harder), the situation and who/if any they are acting upon (if your trying to shoot
someone who is very fast, it will be harder)

#### Rolling for the Outcome

The player or GM then rolls the dice and sees the result based on the [Outcome Scale](#outcome-scale). They increase or decrease the **Outcome Result** by the **Difficulty Rating** to get
a **Final Result**. E.g. the difficulty is easy (-1) and you rolled a fail(4) so it becomes a success(3)

#### What Happened

The GM uses the **Final Result** to narrate how the action played out, based on the description in
the [Outcome Scale](#outcome-scale).

### Combat and Damage

#### Who Goes First

At the start of a battle, give each character or object, that will have a turn and initiative card
(1 goes first etc). The GM can decide on the order or give the cards out randomly.

#### Making a Decision

When it's your turn in combat you must limit your turn to anything your character can do in 5 seconds

#### Deciding how Much Damage to Deal

Every weapon or type of attack will have an **Damage Strength** as described on the [Damage
Scale](#damage-scale). If making an attack with a makeshift weapon that doesn't have a **Damage Strength**, the
GM get's to pick one based off the [Damage Scale](#damage-scale).

By default the amount of damage you inflict is equal to the **Damage Rating** of the **Damage
Strength** as shown on the [Damage Scale](#damage-scale).

However the GM can increase or decrease the **Damage Strength** based on **Final Result** and any
situational factors, such as attacking a specifically vunerable part of somebody or attacking with a
less strong part of the weapon.

The character looses health equal to the **Final Damage Rating**.

#### Dying

When a character has reached 0 health they are now dead, you may have abilities or items that might prevent you from dying, make sure you use them

### Using Weapons, Equipment and Abilities

- Weapons
  - May describe special rules of give an indication of how much damage they usually do
- Equipment
  - Use the description on the card to inspire how you use it
- Abilities
  - Follow the card description

### Keeping Track

Use the counters to keep track of things like health, ammo, money etc

### Finishing the Game

You finish the game under several situations

- You complete the scenario objectives
- GM may decide to wrap up the story a little after the objectives are complete
- The objectives are now impossible to complete
- E.g. a character you were meant to save has died
- Every player dies
- Enough players dies that you got bored
- You got bored anyway

## Reference Scales and Tables

### Difficulty Scale

Any time a character or object needs to make a check the GM will decide how easy or hard the action
is going to be. They pick one of the options from this scale.

| Difficulty | Description                                                                                          | Difficulty Rating |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Very Easy  | This action is so easy for you, the only way to fail is to get extremely unlucky and critically fail | -2                |
| Easy       | This is an easy action, most of the time you've got this                                             | -1                |
| 50/50      | There is no reason why this action would be easy or hard for you                                     | 0                 |
| Hard       | This is a difficult action for you, most of the time you will fail                                   | +1                |
| Very Hard  | This action is very difficult, you will always fail unless you get very lucky and critically         | +2                |

| Bad Fail         | You failed so badly. This is going to hurt                                                      | 5              | 2-4      |
