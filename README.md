  - Making decisions and outcomes
  - For any action worth rolling for the outcome, the GM decides how challenging it is based off this Difficulty Scale. (From the point of view of the character, monster or object initiating the action) They take into account characters skills (advantages make something easier, disadvantages harder), the situation and who/if any they are acting upon (if your trying to shoot someone who is very fast, it will be harder)
    - Very easy (-2)
    - Easy (-1)
    - 50/50 (0)
    - Hard (+1)
    - Very hard (+2)
  - The player or GM then rolls the dice and sees the result based on the following table. They increase or decrease the result by the difficulty rating to get a final result. E.g. the difficulty is easy (-1) and you rolled a fail(4) so it becomes a success(3)
    - Critical success (1/20) 20
    - Great success (3/20) 17-19
    - Success (6/20)11-16
    - Fail (6/20) 5-10
    - Bad fail (3/20) 2-4
    - Critical fail (1/20) - 1
  - The GM uses the final result to narrate how the action played out
  - Combat and damage
    - During combat the game is slowed down and characters ... Initiative?
    - When it's your turn in combat you must limit your turn to anything you can do in 5 seconds
    - When attacking you make a roll the same as described above. However to calculate the amount of damage you do the GM gets to take into account what you attacked with and how well you rolled, then picks an outcome from the following damage scale, and deals that amount of damage to the characters health:
      - Miniscule (-1)
      - Small amount of damage (-2)
      - Medium damage (-3)
      - Heavy damage (-4)
      - Incredible damage (-5)
      - Absolutely devestating (-6)
