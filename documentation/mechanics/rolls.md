# Roll mechanics
### Roll mechanics describes the basic limitations to rolling for actions or checks, along with how to apply modifiers. Roll tables are mentioned under the mechanics for specific effects.

## Types of Roll
- #### Critical success
	A critical success results in an action that will definitely succeed in either moving the plot forward or significantly aiding in combat. This could include that bartender happening to know exactly what's happening inside the princess' bedroom *somehow*, or the attack dealing double damage, the opponent dropping their sword, or some similar effect.
- #### Great success
	You had a vision in mind, and you nailed it. You achieved the result so easily, you may have time for a bonus action.
- #### Success
	It worked! Complete your action, pass that check.
- #### Meh
	Nothing of note happens. Dwell upon your mediocrity as someone else takes their turn.
- #### Failure
	The action or check didn't work. You could have merely been unlucky, or worded something poorly. Trying again is always an option.
- #### Great Failure
	This represents a failure without question. Attempting the same action again will receive a negative modifier. Don't dwell on this mistake, it only leads to further embarrassment.
- #### Critical Failure
	This represents a total failure. Either this will dead end your avenue of enquiry with a particular character or clue, cause your character to suffer damage to themselves or their items or some other highly disadvantageous act to occur. When people say that it's better to try and fail, that never try at all... they have forgotten that critical failure exists.

## Modifiers
### There are two types of modifier in the game:
1. Roll bonus/penalty
2. Advantage/Disadvantage

#### Roll bonuses and penalties
These modifiers to rolls are caused by **passive effects**, such as persistent buffs or debuffs from items, or long term status effects. A good example is an item that gives a bonus to a characters dexterity, helping them to jump across an obstacle.

#### Bonuses and crits
Despite having a +1 or a -1 to a roll, a critical failure, or a critical success is always possible.

#### Advantage and disadvantage
This involves rolling extra dice, before picking the lowest or highest roll (depending on whether advantaged or disadvantaged). This modifiers are caused by **character action** ,and are more powerful than a simple roll modifier. Examples are short term buffs and debuffs cast by a character onto another, such as a buff to accuracy for the next two shots.
