## Problem

_What's the problem?_

Most Tabletop RPG systems like Dungeons and Dragons, GURPS and Pathfinder are complex and intimidating to new RPG players or those who want a light gaming experience. Role playing is super fun, but could be made more accessible.

It is also quite hard for people to start out being a Game Master for these kind of campaigns. There's typically a lot of research and planning that needs to go into it, making it harder for anyone to start.

### Existing Alternatives

_How else are people solving this problem right now?_

There's various game systems out there, some of which attempt to simplify the gaming experience.

TODO: Need to fill in more examples here.

## Customers

_Who has this problem?_

People who enjoy tabletop gaming, story telling and role playing

### Early Adopters

_Who are the very first people who would use this?_

Tabletop gamers in the improvised comedy and theatre scene

## Solution

_How are you solving the problems? Add a link to the latest place to find the current solution_

A table top RPG system, resources and tools that make setup and playing an RPG very quick and fun. So more focus can be spent on the story and having a laugh. This includes:

- A super simple set of semantic rules for a tabletop RPG system, that removes as many calculations and numbers as possible
- A set of cards and resources to speed up character creation, scenario setup and the play of the game
- A set of tools that make it much easier for people to play as the Game Master

### High Level Concept

_Describe the solution in a few words that anyone could understand_

Much simpler kind of Dungeons and Dragons, played with cards and tools that make running the game super easy.

### Unique Value Proposition

_What's unique about this solution?_

- Uses cards to create characters, so this setup is very fast
- Uses a semantic system to make it less "mathematical" and more natural to understand
- Focussed on short play and 1 shots, so it's easy to play with new players and in shorter timelines than other products

## Channels

_How are you reaching your customers?_

- Directly for the initial early adopters who we know personally
- Social media mainly

## Costs

_How are/will you be spending money?_

- Physical printing costs
- Getting artwork commissioned, as the core team does not have this skill set
- Servers and hosting as necessary

## Uncertainties

_What are you most uncertain about? Prioritise this list and add potential tests to help us become more certain_

- **Description of uncertainty** _(Potential test description, keep everything on 1 line so can sort easier)_

- **The ratio between PC health, NPC health and damage values of attacks and weapons**
- **How to make the GM role super easy, so not setup is needed**
- **What should the theme for the first release be (fantasy, sci-fy etc)**
- **What should the tone of the game be (e..g Discworld, more serious fantasy ala D&D etc)**
- **What should the first set of cards consist of**
- **What are the best set of core skills needed**
- **How should speed/initiative work**
- **How should we keep track of health for various PC's and NPC's**
- **How do we want people to be visualising the map, digital physical etc**
- **How/what do we display as reference rules to players as the game is being played. If anything**
- **How should we manage range and distance**
- **Should we focus on 1 shots, or campaign play**
- **Is the current system for checks and battle working, could things like classic advantage/disadvantage help or be too confusing**
- **How should we limit powerful abilities/weapons/ammo related things**
- **How does dying work**
- **What status cards do we need and how many**
- **Would allowing players to re-roll if they have proficiency in a skill be a good idea, if they have to take the next result? Adds a fun gamble to the game.**
- **Should we have rolling for hit and rolling for dodge/armour? 1 roll doesn't feel like there's enough player agency**
- **Would fate cards work better than rolling and the story?**
