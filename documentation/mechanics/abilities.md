# Abilities
### Abilities tend to come in a few discreet types, especially damaging ones, in order to create balance, we can limit the available options to a tree of abilities, each with side effects, that can be updated later.

In order to create more interesting abilities, each type can have secondary effects.

## Damage styles
#### Displayed below are the main categories, subcategories, plus the effects these categories can leave or create. Effects are discussed later. All categories can do damage, but perhaps the way in which they achieved these can stick to the thematic. Blunt trauma healing is hard to envisage.
- Physical
  - Slashing - *DOT*
  - Blunt - *Armour Pen*
  - Piercing - *Extra Crit*
- Elemental
  - Fire/Heat - *DOT plus illumination*
  - Ice/Cold - *Slow or Agi penalties*
  - Air/Wind - *Movement modifiers and knockbacks*
- Spiritual
  - Mental - *Perception changes*
  - Divine - *Delayed action and healing*
  - Zeal - *Advantage and disadvantage*
  - Necromantic - *Assistance from the other side*
- Nature
  - Decay - *status effects*
  - Growth - *HOTs and terrain altering abilities*

#### Note, it's possible to have situations where what may seem like one type of ability is described by another. For example, sending a chunk of ice hurtling toward an enemy is not an elemental attack, that's a blunt physical attack. Try it at home for proof.
