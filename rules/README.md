## Setup

### What You Need

- The Random Event mobile app/website
- The Random Event card decks (optional, also in the app/website)
- A **Battle Map** (For visualising where people are during battles)
- **Pawns** for the battle map
- A whiteboard marker for the **Battle Map**

### Story Setup

- Decide on 1 player to be the **Game Master**, they will be narrating the events of the story for
  the players.
- Go to our app/website and search for a **Story** you like the look of
- The **Game Master** reads the whole **Story** and announces any special rules or setup to the players
- The **Game Master** prepares the **Monsters** and **Non Playable Characters** (before any other player draws cards)
  - Set aside the **Monster** cards specified in the chosen **Story**
  - For each major **Non Playable Character** listed in the **Story** pick out the **Character**, **Skills**, **Weapons**, **Items** and **Ability** cards for them.

### Creating Characters

For each player do the following:

- Pick 1 **Character** card
  - This is who you will be role playing as. There is a description on the card to give you a bit of
    context, and a unique **Character Ability** which only you can use.
- Pick 6 random **Skills** (3 **Positive Side** up, 3 **Negative Side** up)
  - These represent what you are good and bad at, and make certain **Actions** easier or harder when you
    attempt them. The cards may have descriptions to help you understand when they might effect your
    **Actions**
- Pick 2 random **Weapons**
- Pick 2 random **Items**
- Pick 3 random **Abilities**
- Start thinking about your characters back story and motivations

## Playing

### Taking Actions and Outcomes (Making a Check)

For any **Action** where the **Outcome** is uncertain, the character or object initiating that **Action** will need
to do a **Check** to see how the it pans out. Do they succeed spectacularly, fail miserably, or does not much
happen?

A check is split into 3 stages:

1. [Judging the Difficulty](#judging-the-difficulty)
2. [Rolling for the Outcome](#rolling-for-the-outcome)
3. [What Happened](#what-happened)

You may also want to see [Deciding how Much Damage to Deal](#deciding-how-much-damage-to-deal) when
deciding [What Happened](#what-happened)

#### Judging the Difficulty

The GM decides how challenging it is based off the
[Difficulty Scale](#difficulty-scale) (From the point of view of the character, monster or object
initiating the action). They take into account characters skills (advantages make something easier,
disadvantages harder), the situation and who/if any they are acting upon (if your trying to shoot
someone who is very fast, it will be harder)

#### Rolling for the Outcome

The player or GM then rolls the dice and sees the result based on the [Outcome Scale](#outcome-scale). They increase or decrease the **Outcome Result** by the **Difficulty Rating** to get
a **Final Result**. E.g. the difficulty is easy (-1) and you rolled a fail(4) so it becomes a success(3)

#### What Happened

The GM uses the **Final Result** to narrate how the action played out, based on the description in
the [Outcome Scale](#outcome-scale).

### Combat and Damage

#### Who Goes First

At the start of a battle, give each character or object, that will have a turn and initiative card
(1 goes first etc). The GM can decide on the order or give the cards out randomly.

#### Making a Decision

When it's your turn in combat you must limit your turn to anything your character can do in 5 seconds

#### Deciding how Much Damage to Deal

Every weapon or type of attack will have a **Damage Strength** as described on the [Damage
Scale](#damage-scale). If making an attack with a makeshift weapon that doesn't have a **Damage Strength**, the
GM get's to pick one based off the [Damage Scale](#damage-scale).

By default the amount of damage you inflict is equal to the **Damage Rating** of the **Damage
Strength** as shown on the [Damage Scale](#damage-scale).

However the GM can increase or decrease the **Damage Strength** based on **Final Result** and any
situational factors, such as attacking a specifically vunerable part of somebody or attacking with a
less strong part of the weapon.

The character looses health equal to the **Final Damage Rating**.

#### Dying

When a character has reached 0 health they are now dead, you may have abilities or items that might prevent you from dying, make sure you use them

### Using Weapons, Items and Abilities

- Weapons
  - May describe special rules of give an indication of how much damage they usually do
- Items
  - Use the description on the card to inspire how you use it
- Abilities
  - Follow the card description

### Keeping Track

Use the tracker in the mobile app to keep track of things like health, ammo, money etc

### Finishing the Game

You finish the game under several situations

- You complete the scenario objectives
- GM may decide to wrap up the story a little after the objectives are complete
- The objectives are now impossible to complete
- E.g. a character you were meant to save has died
- Every player dies
- Enough players dies that you got bored
- You got bored anyway

## Reference Scales and Tables

### Difficulty Scale

Any time a character or object needs to make a check the GM will decide how easy or hard the action
is going to be. They pick one of the options from this scale.

| Difficulty | Description                                                                                          | Difficulty Rating |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Very Easy  | This action is so easy for you, the only way to fail is to get extremely unlucky and critically fail | -2                |
| Easy       | This is an easy action, most of the time you've got this                                             | -1                |
| 50/50      | There is no reason why this action would be easy or hard for you                                     | 0                 |
| Hard       | This is a difficult action for you, most of the time you will fail                                   | +1                |

| Bad Fail         | You failed so badly. This is going to hurt                                                      | 5              | 2-4      |
